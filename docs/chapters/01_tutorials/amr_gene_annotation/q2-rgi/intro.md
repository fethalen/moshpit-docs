# RGI

q2-rgi wraps the functionalities of the [RGI](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac920) tool, 
which is used to predict antibiotic resistomes from assembled sequences or reads based 
on homology and SNP models. The application uses reference data from the 
[Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD)](https://card.mcmaster.ca/).

The CARD database provides comprehensive coverage of resistance mechanisms, including 
both clinical and experimental data. It also includes mechanisms with indirect 
contributions to resistance.

## Installation

q2-rgi isn't part of the MOSHPIT distribution and has to 
be installed separately. Please follow these 
[installation instructions](https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/bokulich-lab/q2-rgi).
