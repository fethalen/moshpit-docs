# AMRFinderPlus

q2-amrfinderplus wraps the functionalities of the [AMRFinderPlus](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91456-0) software. 
AMRFinderPlus is a tool developed by NCBI, together with the accompanying database it
identifies acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in bacterial protein and/or 
assembled 
nucleotide sequences as well as known resistance-associated point mutations for several 
taxa. The database also includes select members of additional classes of genes such as 
virulence factors, biocide, heat, acid, and metal resistance genes.

AMRFinderPlus focuses primarily on clinically relevant 
resistance genes, emphasizing core AMR genes that directly confer resistance.

## Installation

q2-amrfinderplus isn't part of the MOSHPIT distribution and has to 
be installed separately. Please follow the steps described in the QIIME2 installation 
instructions for the 
[pathogenome distribution](https://library.qiime2.org/quickstart/pathogenome#id-3-install-the-base-distributions-conda-environment).
